This is a short Python scripting exercise, and should be run with Python3. We will use the free OpenData API for a game called Dota 2. https://docs.opendota.com/#section/Introduction. The initial free tier (without an API key) should suffice.
Start with the output of the PRO PLAYERS ('/proPlayers') endpoint, and query additional TeamID data as necessary ('/teams/{team_id}').

For the purpose of this exercise, player "experience" will be defined as the amount of time that has passed since the start of a player's data history (start time is available as a player's "full_history_time").
"Team experience" is the sum of all pro player's experience that are part of the same team (according to "team_id").

Goal: Write a Python3 command line script that satisfies all of the following

    Has three or more arguments:
        1. The number of teams included in the output
        2. Output file destination
        3. Logging verbosity
    Uses a Python logging module that logs directly to stderr.
    For the top n teams (by "team_id"), sorted by team experience, output YAML with the following:
        * Team Name
        * Team ID
        * Wins
        * Losses
        * Rating
        * Team Experience
        * For each Player:
            * Personaname
            * Player Experience
            * Country Code

Additional notes and guidelines:
* We've provided a sample argument parser to speed things up. You may also edit it or write your own.
* Feel free to use open-source packages. Declare dependencies in any conventional format.
* There will be some inconsistencies and missing data in the APIâ€™s responses. If the missing data compromises the team experience calculations, exclude the offending teams or players. Otherwise, simply ignore the missing fields.
* When making design decisions for issues not acknowledged in this prompt, use your best judgement and explain your reasoning in comments and docstrings.
* Apple does not run the OpenDOTA service or control its content, so API responses might include offensive language. Please contact us if you have a concern.
